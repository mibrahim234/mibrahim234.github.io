                        <p> Hi, I’m Mohammad Ibrahim. Welcome to my portfolio site. Born and raised in New York City, I was exposed to so many different cultures and unique ways of living life. Growing up here gave me the goal to travel the world. I want to see the beauties of the earth and experience different ways of living life. 
                            As a Marketing major, I graduated from Baruch college on the dean’s list. I enjoyed marketing but I was always curious about software development. The flexibility, the creativity, and the love for coffee intrigued me. Learning how to develop has been fun and I look forward to keep learning and growing. </p>
